# Build and export pdf-titan-arum's images. Thin wrapper around `blastbox
# build-images`, which reads blastbox-images.toml in this repo.
#
# The bash that used to live here (and its three near-copies in the other
# engine repos) is gone. It was correct; the problem was that there were four
# of it and they had drifted -- a different ARG name here, a missing pull
# there, a rootfs exported from an image nobody had verified. The declaration
# is now the single description of the chain and one implementation executes it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build_images.sh <tag> [blastbox-version] [--dry-run]
#
# Env: TITANARUM_FC_DIR      where the Firecracker rootfs is written
#                            (default $HOME/titanarum-bb-fc)
#      TITANARUM_GVISOR_DIR   where the gVisor tree is written
#                            (default $HOME/titanarum-bb-gvisor)
#
# There is no BLASTBOX_SRC here, unlike redtusk: THIS engine's warm Dockerfiles
# live in THIS repo. That distinction is what the 2026-09-02 outage was about --
# the Firecracker rootfs was built from inputs looked for in the wrong tree, so
# the guest had no /init and every warm guest hung to the boot timeout.

# Having the SUBCOMMAND is not the same as having a version that can run it:
# 0.1.33 has `build-images` and it only validates, so an older blastbox exits 2
# saying execution is not implemented -- which reads like a broken script.
# stderr is CAPTURED, not discarded. `2>/dev/null` here cost a real diagnosis:
# blastbox installed without its `host` extra had a console script that died on
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'structlog'`, the traceback went to the
# stderr this line threw away, and the operator was told their current blastbox
# had "no usable version output" -- then handed a reinstall of the same thing.
# That specific cause is fixed in blastbox 0.1.40; this keeps the NEXT one
# visible.
# The streams are kept SEPARATE, and that is not tidiness. Merging them so the
# diagnostic could see stderr meant the version regex saw it too: a traceback
# mentioning `/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/...` yields `3.11`, which sorts
# far above the floor, so a CLI that cannot start would clear the version gate
# and go straight to `blastbox build-images` -- the check defeated by the very
# change meant to explain its failures (codex).
#
# So: the version is parsed from STDOUT of a run that EXITED ZERO. stderr is
# captured only to show the operator what happened.
# The second mktemp happens AFTER the trap is armed. Allocating both first meant a
# failure of the second one -- $TMPDIR out of space or inodes, under `set -e` --
# exited before any cleanup existed and leaked the first (codex).

# `blastbox version` runs in the BACKGROUND and is waited on, which is the only

#
#  * a Ctrl-C or a supervisor's SIGTERM must not strand these temp files, so the
#    handlers clean up;
#  * bash defers a trap until the FOREGROUND command returns, so with a command
#    substitution a hung CLI made the wrapper unkillable -- worse than having no
#    trap at all, where the default disposition would have killed it outright.
#    `wait` is interruptible, so the handler runs immediately;
#  * a handler that only cleans up SWALLOWS the termination, so these reset the
#    trap and re-signal self, giving the caller the 128+n status.
#
# `exec` matters: it makes the subshell BECOME blastbox, so $! is the CLI's own
# pid and killing it kills the CLI rather than orphaning it behind a subshell.
# (codex, three rounds on this block; each of these was measured, not reasoned.)
# GUARD the pid, never default it: `kill 0` does not mean "kill nothing", it
# signals the wrapper's ENTIRE process group -- the caller and its siblings --
# and a signal arriving between installing this trap and assigning BB_PID would
# have done exactly that. Kill the CLI's process GROUP (`-$BB_PID`, which needs
# the `set -m` below), because killing the CLI alone leaves whatever it spawned
# reparented to init and still running. (codex)
# The pid comes from the FILE the job writes as its first act, not from BB_PID.
# A signal arriving between `&` and `BB_PID=$!` left the handler with nothing to
# signal, so it killed the wrapper and left the CLI and its descendants running
# (codex). Reading the file also means this path is exercised by every signal
# test rather than only in the race it was written for.
