# Build and export pdf-titan-arum's images. Thin wrapper around `blastbox
# build-images`, which reads blastbox-images.toml in this repo.
#
# The bash that used to live here (and its three near-copies in the other
# engine repos) is gone. It was correct; the problem was that there were four
# of it and they had drifted -- a different ARG name here, a missing pull
# there, a rootfs exported from an image nobody had verified. The declaration
# is now the single description of the chain and one implementation executes it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build_images.sh <tag> [blastbox-version] [--dry-run]
#
# Env: TITANARUM_FC_DIR      where the Firecracker rootfs is written
#                            (default $HOME/titanarum-bb-fc)
#      TITANARUM_GVISOR_DIR   where the gVisor tree is written

# There is no BLASTBOX_SRC here, unlike redtusk: THIS engine's warm Dockerfiles

# stderr is CAPTURED, not discarded. `2>/dev/null` here cost a real diagnosis:
# blastbox installed without its `host` extra had a console script that died on
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'structlog'`, the traceback went to the
# stderr this line threw away, and the operator was told their current blastbox
# had "no usable version output" -- then handed a reinstall of the same thing.

# The streams are kept SEPARATE, and that is not tidiness. Merging them so the

# mentioning `/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/...` yields `3.11`, which sorts

#
#  * a Ctrl-C or a supervisor's SIGTERM must not strand these temp files, so the

#  * bash defers a trap until the FOREGROUND command returns, so with a command
#    substitution a hung CLI made the wrapper unkillable -- worse than having no
#    trap at all, where the default disposition would have killed it outright.
#    `wait` is interruptible, so the handler runs immediately;
#  * a handler that only cleans up SWALLOWS the termination, so these reset the
#    trap and re-signal self, giving the caller the 128+n status.
#
# `exec` matters: it makes the subshell BECOME blastbox, so $! is the CLI's own
# pid and killing it kills the CLI rather than orphaning it behind a subshell.
# (codex, three rounds on this block; each of these was measured, not reasoned.)
# GUARD the pid, never default it: `kill 0` does not mean "kill nothing", it
# signals the wrapper's ENTIRE process group -- the caller and its siblings --
# and a signal arriving between installing this trap and assigning BB_PID would
# have done exactly that. Kill the CLI's process GROUP (`-$BB_PID`, which needs
# the `set -m` below), because killing the CLI alone leaves whatever it spawned
# reparented to init and still running. (codex)

# A signal arriving between `&` and `BB_PID=$!` left the handler with nothing to

# test rather than only in the race it was written for.
