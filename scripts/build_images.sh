# Build and export pdf-titan-arum's images. Thin wrapper around `blastbox
# build-images`, which reads blastbox-images.toml in this repo.
#
# The bash that used to live here (and its three near-copies in the other
# engine repos) is gone. It was correct; the problem was that there were four
# of it and they had drifted -- a different ARG name here, a missing pull
# there, a rootfs exported from an image nobody had verified. The declaration
# is now the single description of the chain and one implementation executes it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build_images.sh <tag> [blastbox-version] [--dry-run]
#
# Env: TITANARUM_FC_DIR      where the Firecracker rootfs is written
#                            (default $HOME/titanarum-bb-fc)
#      TITANARUM_GVISOR_DIR   where the gVisor tree is written
#                            (default $HOME/titanarum-bb-gvisor)
#
# There is no BLASTBOX_SRC here, unlike redtusk: THIS engine's warm Dockerfiles
# live in THIS repo. That distinction is what the 2026-09-02 outage was about --
# the Firecracker rootfs was built from inputs looked for in the wrong tree, so
# the guest had no /init and every warm guest hung to the boot timeout.

# Having the SUBCOMMAND is not the same as having a version that can run it:

# stderr is CAPTURED, not discarded. `2>/dev/null` here cost a real diagnosis:
# blastbox installed without its `host` extra had a console script that died on
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'structlog'`, the traceback went to the
# stderr this line threw away, and the operator was told their current blastbox
# had "no usable version output" -- then handed a reinstall of the same thing.
# That specific cause is fixed in blastbox 0.1.40; this keeps the NEXT one
# visible.
# The streams are kept SEPARATE, and that is not tidiness. Merging them so the
# diagnostic could see stderr meant the version regex saw it too: a traceback
# mentioning `/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/...` yields `3.11`, which sorts
# far above the floor, so a CLI that cannot start would clear the version gate
# and go straight to `blastbox build-images` -- the check defeated by the very
# change meant to explain its failures (codex).
